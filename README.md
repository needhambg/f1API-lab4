<h3>What It Does<h3>
1. Predicts Drivers Next Race At A Circuit, By Averaging their Last two Years positions together
2. Finds A Drivers Best Placing At A Selected Circuit
3. Prints the Last Two Races And A Given Drivers Placement there

<h3>ISSUES<h3>

1. I had a little problem with how the API responded with JSON for the positions as it returns the last position of each lap. 
2. I had an error with status code returns and it just started working again for no reason
3. I had made an error in the circuit list and fixed it to use the meeting_name rather than circuit_short_name
